# Alfred-the-Butler

## Description

Meet Alfred, your **Telegram** butler with a knack for tech and a sense of humor sharper than a compiler error message. As a Computer Science student or Software Engineer, Alfred is your go-to guy for automating those pesky daily tasks.

LinkedIn job searches giving you a headache? Alfred’s got your back. He’ll sift through the job postings faster than you can say “recursive function”.

Need a LeetCode problem to mull over during your bus ride? Alfred’s got you covered. He can find you a problem faster than you can say “binary search tree”.

Curious about upcoming CodeForces contests? Just ask Alfred. He’s more up-to-date than your calendar app.

In fact, Alfred can assist you with (almost) anything you can think of. He’s like a Swiss Army knife, but for your digital life.

And the best part? You can chat with him like a boss. After all, he’s not just a bot, he’s your loyal sidekick. He might not make you a cup of tea, but he’ll certainly make your life a whole lot easier!

So, why wait? Give Alfred a whirl and let the fun begin!

## Usage

To use Alfred, you first need to have Telegram installed on your machine.
Next, to wake Alfred up, you only have to call him with a simple Python command:

```bash
$ python3 -m alfred.py

Then, Alfred will start initializing its components, including Gmail, LeetCode, Codeforces, etc.

It will ask you for several permissions. But don't worry, it will be fast.

Then Alfred is ready to serve you.
